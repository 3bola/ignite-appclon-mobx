</p>

### Quick Example

```
$ npm install -g ignite-cli
$ ignite new AppclonMobX -b appclon-mobx
$ cd AppclonMobX
$ react-native run-ios

or

$ react-native run-android
```

### Why Ignite?

* Easily spin up a new React Native app with best practices built-in
* No runtime! This is a developer tool only, not a library you have to depend on
* Works with iOS and Android out of the box
* API-ready -- hook it up and start talking to your server
* Standard-js compliant code
* MobX state management

### Why MobX?

MobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP). The philosophy behind MobX is very simple:

Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. Automatically.

### Why MobX over Redux?

Less code than redux, shorter learning curve.
IMHO MobX is a best approach for the most common projects.
Redux is very powerfull, but when you start learning RN you must understand too many concepts before you can even start... and redux is not one of the smallest obstacles i met when i started.

## :arrow_down: Install
